# PHP optician database project
This has been adapted from a group project that I was involved with. I've removed the sidebar links to the pages created by other members of the team in order to showcase the parts that I worked on myself.

The original code and database was hosted on SETU's servers, but after summer exams in 2023, it became no longer possible to access it in full. I copied and edited my code from the Project Manual we submitted for the module, created a MySQL database with the necessary tables, and installed Apache 2.4 on my local machine in order to debug the PHP without needing to host it elsewhere.
