# PHP optician database project
This has been adapted from a group project that I was involved with. I've removed the sidebar links to the pages created by other members of the team in order to showcase the parts that I worked on myself.

This project uses HTML, PHP and JavaScript in conjunction with one another to access a MySQL database and perform Insert, Update and Delete actions through an easy-to-use interface. I have adapted it from a group project that I worked on in my second year of studying Software Development, showcasing only the parts that I worked on.
