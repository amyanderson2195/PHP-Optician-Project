# PHP optician database project
This project uses HTML, PHP and JavaScript in conjunction with one another to access a MySQL database and perform Insert, Update and Delete actions through an easy-to-use interface. I have adapted it from a group project that I worked on in my second year of studying Software Development, showcasing only the parts that I worked on.
